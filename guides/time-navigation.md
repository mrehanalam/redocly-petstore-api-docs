# Warp API Time Navigation Guide

Time navigation is a core feature of Warp, allowing you to move backward, forward, or pause time with precision. This guide will walk you through how to use the Warp API for effective time navigation.

## Overview

Warp's Time Navigation API lets you:
- Travel to specific points in the past or future.
- Pause time for isolated operations.
- Fast-forward or rewind events in real-time or at accelerated speeds.
- Set temporal anchors to mark key moments in your timeline.

## Step 1: Traveling to a Specific Time

To navigate to a particular point in time, you'll need to make a request to the Warp API specifying the destination time and location.

### Traveling to a Specific Time

Use the following `curl` command to travel to a specific date and time:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/travel \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "destination_time": "1889-03-10T23:45:00Z",
  "location": "Tesla's Lab"
}'
```

- **`destination_time`**: The date and time you wish to travel to, in ISO 8601 format.
- **`location`**: The specific location you want to arrive at during this time.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Travel successful",
  "current_time": "1889-03-10T23:45:00Z",
  "location": "Tesla's Lab"
}
```

This response confirms that you have successfully traveled to the specified time and location.

## Step 2: Setting a Temporal Anchor

A temporal anchor is a fixed point in time that you can return to after making changes. Setting an anchor is essential before making significant alterations to the timeline.

### Setting an Anchor

Use the following `curl` command to set a temporal anchor:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/set-anchor \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "timestamp": "2024-09-01T00:00:00Z",
  "description": "Starting Point"
}'
```

- **`timestamp`**: The date and time you wish to anchor, typically the current time before any modifications.
- **`description`**: A brief description of the anchor’s purpose.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "anchor_id": "1234567890abcdef",
  "status": "Anchor set successfully"
}
```

This response confirms that the anchor has been successfully set and provides an `anchor_id` for future reference.

## Step 3: Pausing and Resuming Time

Pausing time allows you to perform actions in a completely isolated environment, preventing any external influence or changes.

### Pausing Time

Use the following `curl` command to pause time:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/pause-time \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Time paused successfully",
  "paused_at": "2024-09-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

This response indicates that time has been successfully paused.

### Resuming Time

When you’re ready to resume time, use the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/resume-time \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Time resumed successfully",
  "current_time": "2024-09-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

This response confirms that time has resumed from the exact moment it was paused.

## Step 4: Fast-Forwarding and Rewinding Time

Sometimes, you may need to move through time quickly without targeting a specific event.

### Fast-Forwarding Time

Use the following `curl` command to fast-forward:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/fast-forward \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "duration": "10m"
}'
```

- **`duration`**: The amount of time you want to skip forward, such as 10 minutes (`10m`), 1 hour (`1h`), or 1 day (`1d`).

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Fast-forward successful",
  "new_time": "2024-09-01T00:10:00Z"
}
```

This response indicates that time has been successfully fast-forwarded.

### Rewinding Time

To rewind time, use the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/rewind \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "duration": "5m"
}'
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Rewind successful",
  "new_time": "2024-09-01T23:55:00Z"
}
```

This response confirms that time has been successfully rewound.

## Step 5: Monitoring Events in Real-Time

While navigating time, you may want to monitor events in real-time, either to observe changes or to intervene if necessary.

### Monitoring Events

Use the following `curl` command to monitor events:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.warp.com/v1/monitor-events \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "location": "HQ",
  "time_range": "2024-09-15T12:00:00Z/2024-09-15T14:00:00Z"
}'
```

- **`location`**: The physical location or event you wish to monitor.
- **`time_range`**: The time range you are interested in.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Monitoring successful",
  "events": [
    {
      "time": "2024-09-15T12:30:00Z",
      "description": "Meeting with key stakeholders"
    },
    {
      "time": "2024-09-15T13:45:00Z",
      "description": "Deployment initiated"
    }
  ]
}
```

This response provides details on the events that occurred within the specified time range.

## Best Practices

- **Always Set Anchors**: Before making any changes, always set a temporal anchor. This ensures you can revert any unwanted modifications.
- **Monitor Paradoxes**: Use the paradox monitoring tools to ensure your changes do not create unintended consequences.
- **Document Changes**: Keep a log of your time navigation activities to track what was done and when. This can be crucial for troubleshooting and audits.

## Conclusion

Time navigation with Warp is a powerful tool that can significantly impact your projects, research, or experiments. By following this guide, you should be well-equipped to start navigating time safely and effectively.
