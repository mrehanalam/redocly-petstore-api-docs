# Warp API Event Manipulation Guide

Event manipulation is one of the most powerful features of Warp, allowing you to modify, adjust, or influence events in the past, present, or future. This guide will show you how to use the Warp API to perform event manipulations safely and effectively.

## Overview

With Warp’s Event Manipulation API, you can:
- Modify past events to change outcomes.
- Influence future events by setting conditions.
- Create and manage alternate timelines.
- Ensure that manipulations do not create paradoxes or unintended consequences.

## Step 1: Identifying an Event

Before you can manipulate an event, you need to identify it within the timeline. Use the API to search for specific events based on time and location.

### Searching for Events

Use the following `curl` command to search for events:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.warp.com/v1/search-events \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "location": "Tesla's Lab",
  "time_range": "1889-03-10T00:00:00Z/1889-03-10T23:59:59Z"
}'
```

- **`location`**: The location where the event took place.
- **`time_range`**: The time range during which the event occurred, in ISO 8601 format.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "event_id": "abcd1234",
      "description": "Tesla tests a new invention",
      "time": "1889-03-10T14:00:00Z",
      "location": "Tesla's Lab"
    },
    {
      "event_id": "efgh5678",
      "description": "Fire breaks out in Tesla's Lab",
      "time": "1889-03-10T23:45:00Z",
      "location": "Tesla's Lab"
    }
  ]
}
```

This response lists events that match your search criteria, including their IDs, descriptions, times, and locations.

## Step 2: Manipulating an Event

Once you've identified the event you want to manipulate, you can use the Warp API to modify its outcome or details.

### Modifying an Event

Use the following `curl` command to manipulate an event:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/manipulate-event \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "event_id": "efgh5678",
  "new_outcome": {
    "description": "Prevent the fire from breaking out",
    "changes": [
      {
        "action": "Remove flammable materials",
        "time": "1889-03-10T23:30:00Z"
      }
    ]
  },
  "safety_check": true
}'
```

- **`event_id`**: The ID of the event you wish to manipulate.
- **`new_outcome`**: The desired outcome after manipulation, including the changes to be made.
- **`safety_check`**: Setting this to `true` ensures the API checks for potential paradoxes or unintended consequences before applying changes.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Manipulation successful",
  "new_event_id": "ijkl9012",
  "description": "Fire prevented successfully",
  "time": "1889-03-10T23:45:00Z"
}
```

This response confirms that the event has been successfully manipulated and provides details about the new event.

## Step 3: Creating an Alternate Timeline

If you want to explore multiple outcomes without affecting the main timeline, you can create an alternate timeline where your manipulations take effect.

### Creating an Alternate Timeline

Use the following `curl` command to create an alternate timeline:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/create-timeline \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "base_timeline_id": "primary",
  "description": "Alternate timeline to prevent the fire in Tesla's Lab"
}'
```

- **`base_timeline_id`**: The ID of the timeline from which to branch off (use `"primary"` for the main timeline).
- **`description`**: A brief description of the new timeline's purpose.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "timeline_id": "mnop3456",
  "status": "Timeline created successfully",
  "description": "Alternate timeline to prevent the fire in Tesla's Lab"
}
```

This response confirms that an alternate timeline has been created, allowing you to perform manipulations without affecting the primary timeline.

## Step 4: Monitoring for Paradoxes

After manipulating events, it’s crucial to ensure that your changes haven’t created any paradoxes or other unintended effects.

### Checking for Paradoxes

Use the following `curl` command to check for paradoxes:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.warp.com/v1/check-paradox \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "timeline_id": "primary"
}'
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "No paradoxes detected",
  "timeline_stability": "Stable"
}
```

This response indicates that your timeline is stable and free from paradoxes.

## Step 5: Reverting Event Manipulations

If a manipulation has unintended consequences, you can revert the event to its original state.

### Reverting an Event

Use the following `curl` command to revert an event:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/revert-event \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "event_id": "ijkl9012"
}'
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Event reverted successfully",
  "original_event_id": "efgh5678"
}
```

This response confirms that the event has been reverted to its original state.

## Best Practices

- **Use Safety Checks**: Always enable safety checks when manipulating events to prevent paradoxes and other issues.
- **Work in Alternate Timelines**: When experimenting with major changes, use alternate timelines to avoid affecting the main timeline.
- **Document Your Changes**: Keep a log of all event manipulations, including the reasons and outcomes, to track changes and troubleshoot if needed.

## Conclusion

Event manipulation with Warp is a powerful tool that lets you control and modify events across time. By following this guide, you can confidently manipulate events while minimizing the risks of unintended consequences.
