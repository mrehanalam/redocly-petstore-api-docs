# Automated Event Manipulation

## Introduction

Automated event manipulation allows you to script and automate the manipulation of events within timelines, making it possible to carry out complex temporal operations without manual intervention. This guide will walk you through setting up automated event manipulations using the Warp API, enabling you to create dynamic, self-adjusting timelines.

## Overview

Warpâ€™s Automated Event Manipulation features allow you to:
- Script automated changes to events based on specific conditions or triggers.
- Schedule event manipulations to occur at designated times.
- Integrate with external systems for dynamic event manipulation.
- Ensure that automated changes do not create paradoxes or disrupt timeline stability.

## Step 1: Scripting Automated Event Changes

Creating scripts for event manipulation allows you to define specific conditions under which events should be altered. These scripts can be triggered automatically based on various criteria.

### Creating an Automation Script

Use the following `curl` command to create an automation script:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/create-script \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "script_name": "Auto-Adjust Project X Launch",
  "trigger_event_id": "event-5678abcd",
  "conditions": {
    "check_date": "2024-08-30T00:00:00Z",
    "status_check": "on_schedule"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "modify_event",
      "event_id": "event-5678abcd",
      "new_time": "2024-09-02T00:00:00Z",
      "new_details": "Launch rescheduled to adjust for delays"
    }
  ]
}'
```

- **`script_name`**: The name of the script.
- **`trigger_event_id`**: The ID of the event that triggers the script.
- **`conditions`**: Conditions under which the script should be executed.
- **`actions`**: A list of actions to be performed when the script is triggered.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "script_id": "script-1234abcd",
  "status": "Script created successfully",
  "script_name": "Auto-Adjust Project X Launch"
}
```

This response confirms that the automation script has been successfully created.

## Step 2: Scheduling Automated Event Manipulations

In addition to scripting, you can schedule event manipulations to occur automatically at specific times, ensuring that timeline adjustments happen precisely when needed.

### Scheduling an Event Manipulation

Use the following `curl` command to schedule an event manipulation:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/schedule-manipulation \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "event_id": "event-5678abcd",
  "scheduled_time": "2024-09-02T00:00:00Z",
  "manipulation_details": {
    "new_time": "2024-09-02T02:00:00Z",
    "new_details": "Rescheduled launch time to avoid conflict"
  }
}'
```

- **`scheduled_time`**: The time when the manipulation should occur.
- **`manipulation_details`**: The details of the event manipulation to be applied.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Event manipulation scheduled successfully",
  "scheduled_time": "2024-09-02T00:00:00Z"
}
```

This response confirms that the event manipulation has been successfully scheduled.

## Step 3: Integrating with External Systems

For more dynamic automation, you can integrate Warp with external systems, such as CI/CD pipelines, monitoring tools, or IoT devices, to trigger event manipulations based on real-time data.

### Triggering Event Manipulation from External Systems

Use the following `curl` command to trigger an event manipulation based on external input:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/trigger-external-manipulation \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "external_system": "CI/CD Pipeline",
  "trigger_conditions": {
    "build_status": "failed",
    "timestamp": "2024-09-01T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "modify_event",
      "event_id": "event-5678abcd",
      "new_details": "Delay launch due to build failure"
    }
  ]
}'
```

- **`external_system`**: The name of the external system providing input.
- **`trigger_conditions`**: Conditions from the external system that will trigger the manipulation.
- **`actions`**: Actions to be taken based on the external input.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Event manipulation triggered by external system",
  "external_system": "CI/CD Pipeline"
}
```

This response confirms that the event manipulation has been triggered based on input from the external system.

## Step 4: Ensuring Stability with Automated Changes

Automated event manipulations must be carefully managed to avoid creating paradoxes or destabilizing the timeline.

### Monitoring for Paradoxes

Use the following `curl` command to monitor the timeline for paradoxes after an automated manipulation:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.warp.com/v1/check-paradox \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "timeline_id": "primary",
  "after_event_id": "event-5678abcd"
}'
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "No paradoxes detected",
  "timeline_stability": "Stable"
}
```

This response confirms that no paradoxes were detected, ensuring the timeline remains stable after the automated manipulation.

## Step 5: Auditing Automated Event Manipulations

Maintaining an audit trail of all automated event manipulations is crucial for transparency and troubleshooting.

### Retrieving the Automation Log

Use the following `curl` command to retrieve a log of all automated event manipulations:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.warp.com/v1/automation-log \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "timeline_id": "primary",
  "date_range": "2024-09-01T00:00:00Z/2024-09-30T23:59:59Z"
}'
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Automation log retrieved successfully",
  "log_entries": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-09-01T12:00:00Z",
      "event_id": "event-5678abcd",
      "action_taken": "Rescheduled launch time"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-09-05T14:00:00Z",
      "event_id": "event-6789efgh",
      "action_taken": "Delayed deployment due to system outage"
    }
  ]
}
```

This response provides a detailed log of all automated event manipulations, ensuring that you have a clear record of changes made to the timeline.

## Best Practices

- **Test Automation Scripts Thoroughly**: Before deploying automated event manipulations, test your scripts in a sandbox environment to ensure they work as expected.
- **Monitor Timeline Stability**: Continuously monitor your timelines for paradoxes or instability after automated changes to prevent unintended consequences.
- **Maintain Detailed Logs**: Keep detailed logs of all automated manipulations for transparency and to facilitate troubleshooting if issues arise.

## Conclusion

Automated event manipulation provides powerful capabilities for managing timelines efficiently and dynamically. By scripting and scheduling automated changes, and integrating with external systems, you can ensure that your timelines remain accurate and responsive to real-time conditions, all while maintaining stability and avoiding paradoxes.
