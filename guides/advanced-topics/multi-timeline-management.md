# Multi-Timeline Management and Merging

## Introduction

Warp’s multi-timeline management feature allows you to create, manage, and merge multiple timelines, providing the flexibility to experiment with different scenarios without affecting your primary timeline. This guide will walk you through advanced techniques for managing these timelines effectively and safely.

## Overview

With Warp’s Multi-Timeline Management API, you can:
- Create new timelines branching off from an existing one.
- Manage multiple timelines simultaneously.
- Merge timelines to consolidate outcomes or prevent divergent realities.
- Monitor and resolve conflicts between timelines.

## Step 1: Creating a New Timeline

Creating a new timeline allows you to explore alternate outcomes without affecting your primary timeline. This is particularly useful for testing different strategies or outcomes in a controlled environment.

### Creating a Timeline Branch

Use the following `curl` command to create a new timeline:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/create-timeline \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "base_timeline_id": "primary",
  "description": "Exploring alternate outcomes for Project X"
}'
```

- **`base_timeline_id`**: The ID of the timeline from which to branch off (use `"primary"` for the main timeline).
- **`description`**: A brief description of the purpose of this new timeline.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "timeline_id": "alt-1234abcd",
  "status": "Timeline created successfully",
  "description": "Exploring alternate outcomes for Project X"
}
```

This response confirms that a new timeline has been created successfully.

## Step 2: Managing Multiple Timelines

Once you have multiple timelines, it’s important to manage them effectively to keep track of changes, outcomes, and conflicts.

### Listing All Timelines

Use the following `curl` command to list all existing timelines:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.warp.com/v1/list-timelines \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "timelines": [
    {
      "timeline_id": "primary",
      "description": "Main timeline",
      "status": "Active"
    },
    {
      "timeline_id": "alt-1234abcd",
      "description": "Exploring alternate outcomes for Project X",
      "status": "Active"
    }
  ]
}
```

This response provides a list of all active timelines, including their IDs, descriptions, and statuses.

### Switching Between Timelines

To make changes in a specific timeline, you must switch your active timeline. Use the following `curl` command to do this:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/switch-timeline \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "timeline_id": "alt-1234abcd"
}'
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Switched to timeline alt-1234abcd",
  "current_time": "2024-09-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

This response confirms that you have successfully switched to the specified timeline.

## Step 3: Merging Timelines

Merging timelines allows you to consolidate outcomes from multiple timelines into one, ensuring that key decisions or events are preserved across different scenarios.

### Merging Two Timelines

Use the following `curl` command to merge two timelines:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/merge-timelines \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "source_timeline_id": "alt-1234abcd",
  "destination_timeline_id": "primary",
  "conflict_resolution": "source_overwrite"
}'
```

- **`source_timeline_id`**: The ID of the timeline you want to merge into another.
- **`destination_timeline_id`**: The ID of the timeline into which you want to merge the source timeline.
- **`conflict_resolution`**: Specifies how to resolve conflicts between the timelines. Options include `"source_overwrite"`, `"destination_preserve"`, and `"manual_review"`.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Timelines merged successfully",
  "merged_timeline_id": "primary",
  "conflicts_resolved": true
}
```

This response confirms that the timelines have been merged successfully, with conflicts resolved according to the specified method.

## Step 4: Resolving Conflicts Between Timelines

When merging timelines, conflicts may arise if the same events have different outcomes. These conflicts need to be resolved to maintain timeline stability.

### Manual Conflict Resolution

If you choose `"manual_review"` for conflict resolution, you will need to manually resolve each conflict. Use the following `curl` command to review and resolve conflicts:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.warp.com/v1/review-conflicts \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "merged_timeline_id": "primary"
}'
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "conflicts": [
    {
      "event_id": "event-5678abcd",
      "source_outcome": "Event A occurred",
      "destination_outcome": "Event B occurred"
    }
  ],
  "resolution_options": [
    "Keep Event A",
    "Keep Event B",
    "Custom Merge"
  ]
}
```

This response lists all conflicts, along with options for resolving each one. You can then choose the appropriate resolution.

### Resolving a Conflict

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.warp.com/v1/resolve-conflict \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "event_id": "event-5678abcd",
  "resolution": "Keep Event A"
}'
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "Conflict resolved successfully",
  "resolved_event_id": "event-5678abcd"
}
```

This response confirms that the conflict has been resolved as specified.

## Best Practices

- **Document All Timelines**: Keep detailed records of each timeline, including its purpose, major changes, and reasons for creation. This will help you manage and merge timelines effectively.
- **Use Conflict Resolution Wisely**: Choose the conflict resolution method that best fits your project’s needs. Manual review, while time-consuming, offers the highest level of control.
- **Regularly Review Timelines**: Periodically review and merge timelines to prevent the proliferation of divergent realities that are difficult to manage.

## Conclusion

Managing and merging multiple timelines with Warp provides you with unparalleled flexibility in experimenting with different scenarios and outcomes. By following this guide, you can ensure that your timelines remain stable and that your time travel operations yield consistent results.
