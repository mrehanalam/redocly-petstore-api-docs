# Custom Extensions and Plugins for Warp

## Introduction

Warp is a powerful time manipulation platform, but its full potential can be unlocked through custom extensions and plugins. These customizations allow you to extend Warp’s functionality, integrate with other systems, and tailor the platform to meet specific needs. This guide provides an overview of how to develop and deploy custom extensions and plugins for Warp.

## Overview

Warp’s extensibility features enable you to:
- Develop custom extensions to add new capabilities to Warp.
- Integrate Warp with other tools and platforms through plugins.
- Automate workflows by creating custom scripts and triggers.
- Contribute to the Warp community by sharing your extensions and plugins.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you begin creating custom extensions or plugins, you need to set up your development environment. This includes installing the necessary tools and libraries.

### Required Tools

- **Warp SDK**: The Software Development Kit (SDK) provides the tools and libraries you need to build extensions for Warp.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that is required for developing Warp plugins.
- **Git**: A version control system for managing your extension or plugin code.

#### Installing Warp SDK

You can install the Warp SDK using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g warp-sdk
```

This command installs the SDK globally, making it available for all your Warp development projects.

## Step 2: Creating a Custom Extension

Custom extensions allow you to add new features or modify existing functionality in Warp. These extensions can range from simple utilities to complex integrations.

### Creating a Basic Extension

To create a basic extension, use the following command:

```bash
warp-sdk create-extension my-extension
```

This command generates a template for your extension, including the necessary files and folders.

### Example: Adding a New Time Travel Method

Here’s an example of a simple extension that adds a new time travel method:

```javascript
// src/my-extension.js

module.exports = {
  name: "My Time Travel Method",
  description: "A custom method for enhanced time travel.",
  execute: (timeline, options) => {
    // Custom time travel logic
    console.log(`Traveling to ${options.destinationTime} in timeline ${timeline}`);
    // ... add your custom logic here ...
  }
};
```

### Registering the Extension

After creating your extension, register it with Warp using the following command:

```bash
warp-sdk register-extension my-extension
```

This command makes the extension available within your Warp environment.

## Step 3: Developing Plugins for Integration

Plugins are used to integrate Warp with other systems, such as CI/CD pipelines, databases, or monitoring tools. Plugins can automate workflows, synchronize data, or trigger time travel events based on external inputs.

### Example: Integrating Warp with a CI/CD Pipeline

Here’s an example of a plugin that triggers a time travel event when a build fails in a CI/CD pipeline:

```javascript
// src/ci-cd-integration.js

module.exports = {
  name: "CI/CD Integration",
  description: "Triggers time travel events based on CI/CD pipeline results.",
  onBuildFailure: (buildInfo) => {
    // Trigger time travel event
    warp.triggerEvent({
      timeline: "primary",
      event: "rollback",
      destinationTime: buildInfo.lastSuccessfulBuildTime,
      reason: "CI/CD build failure"
    });
  }
};
```

### Deploying the Plugin

Deploy the plugin to Warp using the following command:

```bash
warp-sdk deploy-plugin ci-cd-integration
```

This command deploys the plugin, enabling it to interact with your CI/CD pipeline.

## Step 4: Automating Workflows with Custom Scripts

In addition to extensions and plugins, you can create custom scripts that automate repetitive tasks or complex workflows within Warp.

### Example: Automating Timeline Monitoring

Here’s an example of a script that automatically monitors a timeline for anomalies:

```javascript
// scripts/monitor-timeline.js

const monitorTimeline = async (timelineId) => {
  const anomalies = await warp.checkTimelineAnomalies(timelineId);
  if (anomalies.length > 0) {
    console.log(`Anomalies detected in timeline ${timelineId}:`, anomalies);
    // Take corrective action
    warp.correctAnomalies(timelineId, anomalies);
  } else {
    console.log(`No anomalies detected in timeline ${timelineId}.`);
  }
};

monitorTimeline("primary");
```

### Scheduling the Script

You can schedule this script to run at regular intervals using a cron job or Warp’s scheduling feature:

```bash
warp-sdk schedule-script monitor-timeline --interval "1h"
```

This command schedules the script to run every hour, ensuring your timeline remains stable.

## Step 5: Sharing Your Extensions and Plugins

Warp encourages community contributions, allowing you to share your custom extensions and plugins with other users. You can publish your work to the Warp Marketplace, where others can discover and install it.

### Publishing to the Warp Marketplace

To publish your extension or plugin, use the following command:

```bash
warp-sdk publish my-extension
```

You can also provide a detailed description, versioning information, and usage instructions to help others understand how to use your contribution.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Extensions Modular**: Design your extensions to be modular, allowing others to reuse or extend your code easily.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test your extensions and plugins in a sandbox environment before deploying them in production.
- **Document Your Work**: Provide clear documentation for your extensions and plugins, including setup instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips.
- **Contribute to the Community**: Share your extensions and plugins with the Warp community to help others and contribute to the platform’s growth.

## Conclusion

Developing custom extensions and plugins for Warp unlocks a new level of functionality and flexibility, enabling you to tailor the platform to your specific needs. Whether you’re adding new features, integrating with other systems, or automating workflows, Warp’s extensibility makes it possible to create powerful, customized time manipulation solutions.
