# About this template: Warp single-sidebars

Redocly offers almost complete flexibility in information architecture.
This website is a demonstration of a common information architecture with a single navbar and multiple sidebars.

The content is meant to be fun and playful, but the information architecture is serious.

## Step 1: Sitemap

Map your content out. A sitemap is different from navigation.

I color code the sitemap to organize the content into logical groupings.

To spare space, I only show the handful of pages in each logical grouping.

## Step 2: Navigation

Decide how you want to organize your navigation.
You can have navbars, sidebars, and footers. Most websites have 1 navbar and 1 footer, but it's not uncommon to have multiple sidebars.
In some exceptions for multi-product website, they have multiple navbars.

I decided this site would have 1 navbar, 1 footer, and a single sidebar. I decided a few pages shouldn't have sidebars such as the home page, and the legal pages.

However, I could have added a sidebar to any of those pages by adding the file to the appropriate `sidebars.yaml` file.

A project with multiple sidebars would have multiple `sidebars.yaml` files (with that exact name but located in different folders).
They can be organized into folders as appropriate.
See an example with multiple sidebars [on GitHub](https://github.com/redocly/warp-multi-sidebars).

This project with a single sidebar is also available on GitHub at the [Warp Single-sidebar template](https://github.com/redocly/warp-single-sidebar).

## Step 3: Home page

The home page is the first page that visitors see.
It is the most important page.

While I usually start with a draft, I often complete the home page last.

The home page can have a hero section, a features section, a benefits section, and a call to action.

In addition, the home page can have a navbar, a footer, and a sidebar.
However, many times people choose not to have a sidebar on the home page.

I start my home page in Markdown because it's easy to write.
Then, I add in the fancier components and design flourishes last.

The same concept applies to any landing page, not just the home page.
