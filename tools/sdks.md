# Warp SDK (Software Development Kit)

## Introduction

The Warp SDK (Software Development Kit) provides developers with a set of tools and libraries for building custom applications, extensions, and integrations on top of the Warp platform. The SDK simplifies the process of interacting with Warp’s API, allowing you to focus on creating powerful time manipulation solutions.

## Overview

With the Warp SDK, you can:
- Develop custom extensions to add new features to Warp.
- Create plugins that integrate Warp with other tools and platforms.
- Automate time travel workflows by writing scripts in familiar programming languages.
- Test and deploy your applications quickly with built-in development tools.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 32 or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

### Installing Warp SDK

You can install the Warp SDK globally on your system using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g adco-warp-sdk
```

This command installs the SDK globally, making it available for your development projects.

## Basic Usage

### Setting Up a New Project

To create a new Warp project, use the following command:

```bash
warp-sdk init my-warp-project
```

This command generates a new project with the necessary files and folders to start developing with Warp.

### Authenticating with Warp

Before you can interact with the Warp API, you need to authenticate with your Warp account:

```bash
warp-sdk auth login
```

This command prompts you to log in with your Warp credentials, generating an authentication token for API requests.

### Making API Requests

The SDK simplifies making API requests to Warp. Here’s an example of how to retrieve a list of timelines:

```javascript
const warp = require('warp-sdk');

warp.timeline.list().then(timelines => {
  console.log(timelines);
});
```

## Advanced Features

### Developing Custom Extensions

You can develop custom extensions to add new functionality to Warp. For example, you can create an extension that introduces a new method for event manipulation:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  name: "Custom Event Manipulation",
  execute: (timeline, event) => {
    // Custom logic for manipulating events
  }
};
```

### Integrating Plugins

The SDK supports the development of plugins that integrate Warp with other tools, such as CI/CD pipelines or monitoring systems. These plugins can trigger time travel operations based on external events.

### Testing and Deployment

Warp SDK includes built-in tools for testing and deploying your applications. You can run unit tests, simulate time travel scenarios, and deploy your code directly to Warp’s environment.

## Best Practices

- **Modular Development**: Keep your code modular to allow for easy maintenance and updates.
- **Use Version Control**: Utilize Git for version control to manage changes and collaborate with other developers.
- **Document Your Code**: Provide clear documentation for your extensions and plugins to ensure they are easy to understand and use.

## Conclusion

The Warp SDK empowers developers to build powerful, customized solutions on the Warp platform. Whether you’re creating new features, integrating with other systems, or automating workflows, the SDK provides the tools you need to succeed.
